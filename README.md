In order to compile (will be made easier later):

1. Download latest version of JUCE or clone latest JUCE repo
2. Open the Projucer executable in the downloads folder or master 
3. Create Audio Plugin preset from choices of plugins
4. Rename the project the same as the repo 
5. Uncheck the global module preset path, and point to the modules folder in JUCE folder
6. Create Project 
7. Copy files under "Source" into your "Source" folder 
8. Build and place .vst3 file in whatever path you choose for your DAW

Happy Clipping!
